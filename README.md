# CafeApp


## Description

This project is to better understand the protocols you adopt to use UITableViews, as well as any other protocols you decide to implement, building UITableViews programmatically with customized UITableViewCells.  

## What you'll learn

* Protocol-Oriented Programming
* Delegation pattern
* Creating UITableView Programmatically
* Customizing UITableViewCells
* Adding Headers to UITableViews 

## What you'll be building

Imagine this app to compliment the Cafe business you own. This app shows all the products you sell from the wide variety of drinks, food items, and merch! Instead of customers having to use QR codes or grabbing a menu that thousands of others have touched, they can conveniently access your menu at any time through the app. Each item has its name, short description, an image, as well as its price.
