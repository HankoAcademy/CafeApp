# CafeApp


## Description

This project helped me better understand the protocols used when adopting UITableViews, additional protocols as needed, and building UITableViews programmatically with customized UITableViewCells.  

## What I learned

* Protocol-Oriented Programming
* Delegation pattern
* Creating UITableView Programmatically
* Customizing UITableViewCells
* Adding Headers to UITableViews 

## What I built

A companion app to compliment <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cafeamigotam/">Caf√© Amigo</a>, a coffee shop in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. This app shows a prototype of potential products they might sell from a wide variety of drinks, food items, and merch! Instead of customers having to use QR codes or grabbing a menu that thousands of others have touched, they can conveniently access the menu at any time through the app. Each item has its name, short description, an image, as well as its price.
